# Toon Verstraelen

I am an associate professor at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/), affiliated with the [Center for Molecular Modeling](https://molmod.ugent.be/).
I use GitHub primarily for research and education purposes.
I obtained my MSc in Engineering Physics in 2003 and obtained my PhD in the same field in 2009.
My fascination with molecular simulations stems from their ability to serve as a *computational microscope* to study the building blocks of matter.
My research focuses on numerical algorithms, computational methods and theoretical foundations of these simulations, as well as their broader application to support research in other fields.
I am also deeply committed to addressing the practical challenges of ensuring transparency and reproducibility in computational research.

## Teaching

I (co)lecture the following courses at UGent:

- [Python for Scientists](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2024/studiefiche/en/C004212) in the [Bachelor of Science in Physics and Astronomy](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2024/bachelor-of-science-in-physics-and-astronomy)
- [Computational Physics](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/studiefiche/en/C004504) in the [Master of Science in Physics and Astronomy](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/master-of-science-in-physics-and-astronomy-CMPHYS-en)
- [Molecular Simulations of Biosystems](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/studiefiche/en/C002727) in the [Master of Science in Biochemistry and Biotechnology](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/master-of-science-in-biochemistry-and-biotechnology-en)
- [Electricity, Magnetism and Sensors](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/studiefiche/en/I002429) in the [Bachelor of Science in Bioscience Engineering](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/bachelor-of-science-in-bioscience-engineering)
- [Electricity and Magnetism](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/studiefiche/en/I700209) in the [Bachelor of Science in Bioscience Engineering Technology](https://studiekiezer.ugent.be/2025/bachelor-of-science-in-bioscience-engineering-technology)

Most of the course materials are hosted on a private GitHub Enterprise instance, but some tutorials from these courses are hosted on public GitHub repositories:

- [Introductory OpenMM tutorial](https://github.com/molmod/openmm-tutorial-msbs) for "Molecular Simulatios of BioSystems"
- [Charge distributions in copper nanostructures](https://github.com/molmod/chargedist) for "Electricity, Magnetism and Sensors"
- [Tiny DFT](https://github.com/theochem/tinydft) and [Tiny FF](https://github.com/molmod/tinyff/) for "Computational Physics"
